    <p class="para">
        <span style="color: red;">
            The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown,
            fuzzy, and found in the produce section
        </span>
        of your local supermarket. But the kiwi is not a fruitâ€”that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About
        the size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird
        found only in New Zealand.

        The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend
        to be very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees
        found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up
        into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi
        makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy
        forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows
        within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest
        burrows, dug early in the season, become overgrown at
        the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the
        female is ready to lay her eggs.

    <h4 id="block4">FAMILY LIFE</h4>

    <P id="habit-para2">
        Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other
        and their chicks, and males purr during mating. Pairs do
        fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she
        is not in the mood for his company. If another kiwi
        invades a pair's territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis
        have been known to fight to the death, although this is
        rare.
        <br>
        <br>

        An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a
        female may choose a new male if a more desirable one
        wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or
        fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows one
        around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested,
        the female might wander off or try to scare him away.

        Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests
        might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug
        by the male.

        <br>
        <br>

        The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs
        are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in color.
        They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg
        might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that would
        be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving
        birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms) baby! Compared to
        the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the
        female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms)
        rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6
        kilograms).
